I am a data engineer student in Oslo, Norway, with an enduring passion for creation.For me, software development is an endless playing field where the only thing stopping you is imagination (and budget :P). My mission is to blur the lines between technology and art. In the end, technology keeps us alive, while art is what we live for.

Programming is like building Lego with unlimited pieces.

When coding, my focus lies on the backend. I like to tinker around with algorithms and data structures. In the backend, Node.js with express is my favorite; however, I won't shy away from frontend development. React.js is my framework of choice, but I keep my eye on a new lightweight framework called Moon by Kabir Shah. UX and UI design is something I like doing on the side as well. Currently, I am doing a deep dive into systems design.

On the side, I enjoy martial arts (Judo), and I have a background in coaching kids and adults. Working with kids as a judo coach at Ippon Judo-club is one of the week's highlights.

I also like to take photos and do graphic design; however, I have a lot left to learn in both areas.

I usually spend my time on GitHub, but I check my email and LinkedIn once in a while too ;)


# Work:

This fall (2020), I got the honor of joining my professor from last year's Inclusive web-design and development class. Together with a few other students, I help shape the course for the new first-year students. It is incredibly rewarding to teach something I am so passionate about to a group of inspired students.

I have already learned a lot about teamwork and teaching. I am looking forward to more experiences throughout the year and beyond!

From January 2017 until June of 2019, I enjoyed working for a team of professional consultants. During the time, I designed, developed, redeveloped, and maintained their website <TextLink to="https://www.coness.no">Coness.no</TextLink>.

I was only 16 when I started and gained skills and experiences that I carry with me to this day.

My longest-standing job is not related to technology at all. For four years and counting now, I have been a judo trainer and coach for kids down to 5 years old and adults up in the 50's and 60's. In contrast to other sports, judo is all about respect and good values. Teaching young kids respect and making them smile is one of the weeks highlights.

I have practiced judo for 12 years now. It is and has been one of the most joyful social environments I have ever come across.
